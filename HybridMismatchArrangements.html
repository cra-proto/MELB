    <h2 id="rules">What are the rules</h2>
    <h1>What are the rules</h1>

    <p>The hybrid mismatch rules address deduction mismatches or non-inclusion mismatches. These mismatches usually arise when a country allows a deduction for cross-border payment and the receipt is not fully included in the ordinary income subject to the recipient’s total tax rate in the other country.</p>

    <p>More specifically, the rules target deduction mismatches or non-inclusion mismatches that arise about the following three types of hybrid mismatch arrangements:</p>

    <h2>Hybrid financial instrument arrangements</h2>
    <p>A hybrid financial instrument arrangement is generally one where a mismatch arises due to differences in the income tax treatment of payments under the tax laws of different countries because of the terms and conditions of a financial instrument (subsection 18.4(10) of the Act).</p>

    <h2>Hybrid transfer arrangements</h2>
    <p>A hybrid transfer arrangement is generally a transaction or series of transactions involving a financial instrument transfer. This type of arrangement is made when a mismatch arises due to different entities being treated as the owner of returns on the transferred instrument under other countries' tax laws (subsection 18.4(12) of the Act).</p>

    <h2>Substitute payment arrangements</h2>
    <p>A substitute payment arrangement is generally an arrangement that would, without the relevant provisions, undermine the integrity of the hybrid mismatch rules. It typically occurs when a payment for the transfer of a financial instrument functions as a substitute for a specific return under the financial instrument. There is a deduction mismatch or non-inclusion mismatch, but it does not need to be hybrid (subsection 18.4(14) of the Act).</p>

    <p>The rules restrict the deduction for dividends received from a foreign affiliate under section 113 of the Act when the dividend is deductible for foreign income tax purposes (subsection 113(5) of the Act).</p>

    <p>The rules also apply to certain situations involving hybrid mismatches between foreign affiliates. Refer to paragraph (b) of variable A of the definition of FAPI under subsection 95(1) and paragraph 95(2)(f.11) of the Act.</p>

    <h2>How the rules apply and who is affected</h2>

    <p>The following table summarizes the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, indicating which taxpayers are affected and the consequences.</p>
    <p>This is only an overview. Please refer to the Act or consult with a tax professional to confirm the conditions for application and consequences of these rules.</p>

    <p>The hybrid mismatch rules generally apply to payments made and dividends received after June 30, 2022, with the following exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A portion of a payment, deemed to be made under subsection 18.4(9) of the Act, that relates to a portion of a notional interest expense and that is deductible under foreign law computed for some time before January 1, 2023 (subsection 12.7(3))</li>
        <li>The rules that apply when computing the income of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer apply only to payments made after June 30, 2024</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules applicable to individuals, trusts, corporations and partnerships</h2>

    <h3>Primary rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 18.4(4) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An amount for a payment is deductible when computing a taxpayer’s income from a business or property</li>
        <li>The deductible payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a hybrid mismatch amount for the payment</li>
        <li>It restricts the deduction of the payment to the extent of the hybrid mismatch amount</li>
        <li>It deems an amount paid or credited as interest, the deduction of which is restricted under 18.4(4) to be a dividend for Part XIII of the Act</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 12.7(3) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A taxpayer is the recipient of a payment*</li>
        <li>The payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement, and there is a foreign deduction component of the hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a hybrid mismatch amount for the payment</li>
        <li>The deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction of the payment is not restricted by a primary hybrid mismatch rule</li>
        <li>It includes the hybrid mismatch amount in income.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary rule in computing income of a foreign affiliate</h3>
    <p>(Paragraph 95(2)(f.11) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A foreign affiliate, or a partnership of which a foreign affiliate is a member, is the recipient of a payment*</li>
        <li>The payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction of the payment without a corresponding inclusion in Canadian ordinary income or foreign ordinary income (in other words, a hybrid mismatch amount).</li>
        <li>The deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction is not restricted by a primary hybrid mismatch rule</li>
        <li>It includes the hybrid mismatch amount for computing the income of the foreign affiliate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is an exception for payments that are recharacterized as income from an active business under subparagraph 95(2)(a)(ii) of the Act. This exception also applies to notional interest payments.</p>

    <h3>Foreign affiliate dividend FAPI inclusion rule</h3>
    <p>(The definition of FAPI in subsection 95(1) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A dividend is received by a foreign affiliate (a subject affiliate) from another foreign affiliate</li>
        <li>Subsection 113(5) of the Act would apply to the subject affiliate if it were a corporation resident in Canada</li>
        <li>It includes, in the FAPI of the subject affiliate, the portion of the dividend that is deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules applicable to only Corporations</h2>

    <h3>Deduction restriction rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 113(5) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A dividend** is received on a share of the capital stock of a foreign affiliate</li>
        <li>The dividend, in whole or in part, is deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
        <li>It restricts the deduction under section 113 to the extent that amounts for the dividend were deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
        <li>The portion of the dividend that is deductible for foreign income tax purposes is deemed not to be a dividend</li>
        <li>There is an available deduction based on non-business foreign taxes paid and applicable to a restricted portion of the dividend deduction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*The hybrid mismatch rules may apply, even if there is no actual interest payment, if a foreign tax law allows a deduction for a notional interest expense related to a debt. When these rules apply, there is a deduction or non-inclusion mismatch (subsection 18.4 (9) of the Act). The notional interest expense will be treated as a payment under the hybrid mismatch rules.</p>

    <p>**A proportionate distribution made by a foreign affiliate on a share is deemed a dividend (subsection 90(2) of the Act). This does not include a distribution made during liquidation and dissolution, on a redemption, acquisition, or cancellation of foreign affiliate shares, or a qualifying return of capital.</p>

    <h2>What to report</h2>

    <p>The hybrid mismatch arrangement rules contain two filing requirements for a payment or dividend received after June 30, 2023:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A taxpayer is required to file a form containing prescribed information if a deduction is restricted under the primary rule or an amount is included in income under the secondary rule (subsection 18.4(21))</li>
        <li>A taxpayer is required to file a form containing prescribed information if the deduction restriction rule applies to a dividend received from a foreign affiliate (subsection 113(7))</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to report</h2>

    <p>The CRA is preparing a form for the reporting requirements related to the hybrid mismatch rules. For more information, visit this web page regularly.</p>
