    <h2 id="rules">What are the rules</h2>
  
    <p>The hybrid mismatch rules address deduction mismatches or non-inclusion mismatches. These mismatches usually arise when a country allows a deduction for cross-border payment and the receipt is not fully included in the ordinary income subject to the recipient’s total tax rate in the other country.</p>
 
    <p>More specifically, the rules target deduction mismatches or non-inclusion mismatches that arise about the following three types of hybrid mismatch arrangements:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>
  <details>
   <summary>1. Hybrid financial instrument arrangements </summary>
   <p>A hybrid financial instrument arrangement is generally one where a mismatch arises due to differences in the income tax treatment of payments under the tax laws of different countries because of the terms and conditions of a financial instrument (subsection 18.4(10) of the Act).</p>
  </details>
 </li>
 <li>
  <details>
   <summary>2. Hybrid transfer arrangements</summary>
   <p>A hybrid transfer arrangement is generally a transaction or series of transactions involving a financial instrument transfer. This type of arrangement is made when a mismatch arises due to different entities being treated as the owner of returns on the transferred instrument under other countries' tax laws (subsection 18.4(12) of the Act).</p>
  </details>
 </li>
 <li>
  <details>
   <summary>3. Substitute payment arrangements</summary>
   <p>A substitute payment arrangement is generally an arrangement that would, without the relevant provisions, undermine the integrity of the hybrid mismatch rules. It typically occurs when a payment for the transfer of a financial instrument functions as a substitute for a specific return under the financial instrument. There is a deduction mismatch or non-inclusion mismatch, but it does not need to be hybrid (subsection 18.4(14) of the Act).</p>
  </details>
 </li>
</ul>		

    <p>The rules restrict the deduction for dividends received from a foreign affiliate under section 113 of the Act when the dividend is deductible for foreign income tax purposes (subsection 113(5) of the Act).</p>

    <p>The rules also apply to certain situations involving hybrid mismatches between foreign affiliates. Refer to paragraph (b) of variable A of the definition of FAPI under subsection 95(1) and paragraph 95(2)(f.11) of the Act.</p>

    <h2>How the rules apply and who is affected</h2>

    <p>The following table summarizes the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, indicating which taxpayers are affected and the consequences.</p>
    <p>This is only an overview. Please refer to the Act or consult with a tax professional to confirm the conditions for application and consequences of these rules.</p>

    <p>The hybrid mismatch rules generally apply to payments made and dividends received after June 30, 2022, with the following exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A portion of a payment, deemed to be made under subsection 18.4(9) of the Act, that relates to a portion of a notional interest expense and that is deductible under foreign law computed for some time before January 1, 2023 (subsection 12.7(3))</li>
        <li>The rules that apply when computing the income of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer apply only to payments made after June 30, 2024</li>
    </ul>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Payment of interest of lease financing amount</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>If a payment of interest or lease financing amount is made between two qualifying members of a group, the members may be able to jointly elect to exclude the payment from IFE and IFR amounts. (Refer to: subsection 18.2(1), definition of “excluded interest”)
	  </li>
</dd>
<dt>Excess capacity of interest and financing expenses (IFE)</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>If you deduct less IFE than the maximum allowed you may have excess capacity at the end of a taxation year. You can, in some circumstances, transfer the cumulative unused excess capacity (CUEC) to another group member by filing a joint election. That member may then be able to deduct additional IFE to the extent of the received capacity. (Refer to: subsection 18.2(4))</li>
</dd>
<dt>Non-capital loss</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>If you are deducting a non-capital loss from a taxation year ending before February 4, 2022, you can elect to treat it as a ”specified pre-regime loss” if you no longer have documentation to support the IFE that is part of the loss, or if it is otherwise beneficial to you. (Refer to: subsection 18.2(1), definition of “specified pre-regime loss”)</li>
</dd>
<dt>Group ratio rules</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>You may be able to elect to use the group ratio rules. These rules use amounts reported on audited consolidated financial statements and may allow a greater IFE deduction. (subsection 18.21(2)). In the first year you elect to use the group ratio rules, you may also elect to exclude “fair value amounts” from your calculations. (Refer to: subsection 18.21(4))</li>
</dd><dt>Foreign property</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>If you have a foreign property accrual loss (FAPL), you can elect to forgo this loss in order to avoid having to include expenses that gave rise to the loss included in your IFE. (Refer to: clause 95(2)(f.11)(ii)E)</li>
</dd>
<dt>Transitional rules</dt>
<dd>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li>You may be able to elect to use the transitional rules. These rules allow taxpayers to elect to determine their excess capacity in accordance with special rules and carry forward their excess capacity for the 3 years just before the first year the EIFEL rules apply. They do this by including it in calculating their CUEC in the first 3 years that the EIFEL rules apply. (Refer to: transitional rules for section 18.2)</li>

<div>
</section>
    <h3>Primary rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 18.4(4) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An amount for a payment is deductible when computing a taxpayer’s income from a business or property</li>
        <li>The deductible payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a hybrid mismatch amount for the payment</li>
        <li>It restricts the deduction of the payment to the extent of the hybrid mismatch amount</li>
        <li>It deems an amount paid or credited as interest, the deduction of which is restricted under 18.4(4) to be a dividend for Part XIII of the Act</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 12.7(3) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A taxpayer is the recipient of a payment*</li>
        <li>The payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement, and there is a foreign deduction component of the hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a hybrid mismatch amount for the payment</li>
        <li>The deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction of the payment is not restricted by a primary hybrid mismatch rule</li>
        <li>It includes the hybrid mismatch amount in income.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary rule in computing income of a foreign affiliate</h3>
    <p>(Paragraph 95(2)(f.11) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A foreign affiliate, or a partnership of which a foreign affiliate is a member, is the recipient of a payment*</li>
        <li>The payment is made under a hybrid mismatch arrangement</li>
        <li>There is a deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction of the payment without a corresponding inclusion in Canadian ordinary income or foreign ordinary income (in other words, a hybrid mismatch amount).</li>
        <li>The deduction in the foreign tax jurisdiction is not restricted by a primary hybrid mismatch rule</li>
        <li>It includes the hybrid mismatch amount for computing the income of the foreign affiliate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is an exception for payments that are recharacterized as income from an active business under subparagraph 95(2)(a)(ii) of the Act. This exception also applies to notional interest payments.</p>

    <h3>Foreign affiliate dividend FAPI inclusion rule</h3>
    <p>(The definition of FAPI in subsection 95(1) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A dividend is received by a foreign affiliate (a subject affiliate) from another foreign affiliate</li>
        <li>Subsection 113(5) of the Act would apply to the subject affiliate if it were a corporation resident in Canada</li>
        <li>It includes, in the FAPI of the subject affiliate, the portion of the dividend that is deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules applicable to only Corporations</h2>

    <h3>Deduction restriction rule</h3>
    <p>(Subsection 113(5) of the Act)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A dividend** is received on a share of the capital stock of a foreign affiliate</li>
        <li>The dividend, in whole or in part, is deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
        <li>It restricts the deduction under section 113 to the extent that amounts for the dividend were deductible for foreign income tax purposes</li>
        <li>The portion of the dividend that is deductible for foreign income tax purposes is deemed not to be a dividend</li>
        <li>There is an available deduction based on non-business foreign taxes paid and applicable to a restricted portion of the dividend deduction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>*The hybrid mismatch rules may apply, even if there is no actual interest payment, if a foreign tax law allows a deduction for a notional interest expense related to a debt. When these rules apply, there is a deduction or non-inclusion mismatch (subsection 18.4 (9) of the Act). The notional interest expense will be treated as a payment under the hybrid mismatch rules.</p>

    <p>**A proportionate distribution made by a foreign affiliate on a share is deemed a dividend (subsection 90(2) of the Act). This does not include a distribution made during liquidation and dissolution, on a redemption, acquisition, or cancellation of foreign affiliate shares, or a qualifying return of capital.</p>

    <h2>What to report</h2>

    <p>The hybrid mismatch arrangement rules contain two filing requirements for a payment or dividend received after June 30, 2023:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A taxpayer is required to file a form containing prescribed information if a deduction is restricted under the primary rule or an amount is included in income under the secondary rule (subsection 18.4(21))</li>
        <li>A taxpayer is required to file a form containing prescribed information if the deduction restriction rule applies to a dividend received from a foreign affiliate (subsection 113(7))</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to report</h2>

    <p>To report amounts before the forms are published, follow the instructions below.</p>
	
    <p>More specifically, the rules target deduction mismatches or non-inclusion mismatches that arise about the following three types of hybrid mismatch arrangements:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>
    <details>
    <summary>If the primary rule applies</summary>

    </ul>

    <p>Also, please send the above information to a taxpayer or foreign affiliate.</p>

    <p>If the deduction restriction rule applies to more than one dividend received in the tax year of the corporation, the letter may include the above information for multiple dividends.</p>
