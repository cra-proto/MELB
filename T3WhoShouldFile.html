It is the responsibility of the parties involved in an arrangement to determine the true nature of their legal relationships and whether they give rise to a trust.</p>
<p>Determining whether a particular arrangement is a trust is a question of fact and law based on an analysis of the facts specific to each situation under the applicable private law. Taxpayers may wish to consult a legal advisor for help in understanding all of the legal consequences of their trust or ownership arrangements.</p>
<p>Refer to: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/enhanced-reporting-rules-trusts-bare-trusts-faq.html#q1-1">Question 1.1 &quot;What is a trust?&quot;</a> on the &quot;Enhanced reporting rules for trusts and bare trusts: Frequently asked questions&quot; page for a general overview of the legal (non-tax) principles that apply to trusts in Canada.</p>
<h2>Rules for tax years ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023</h2>
<p>The rules governing which trusts must file a T3 return have been enhanced for tax years ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>All trusts, unless specific conditions are met, are required to file a T3 return annually.</li>
<li>Generally, all trusts that are required to file a T3 return, other than listed trusts, must include specified information about each reportable entity of the trust (beneficial ownership information), as outlined on&nbsp;Schedule 15, with their T3 return. See below for the <a href="#listedtrusts">listed trusts</a> applicable for tax years ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023.</li>
<li>Bare trusts are subject to the trust reporting rules. However, for the 2023 and 2024 tax years, the CRA will not require bare trusts to file a T3 return, including Schedule 15, unless the CRA makes a direct request for these filings. See below for more information on <a href="#baretrusts">bare trusts</a>.</li>

<li>Receives from the trust property any income, gain, or profit that is allocated to one or more beneficiaries, and the <a href="#trust-has-following" aria-controls="trust-has-following" class="wb-lbx" role="button">trust has <strong>any</strong> of the following&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>:<ul>

<h4>Examples of trusts that need to file under the trust reporting rules</h4>
<p>For, refer to: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/enhanced-reporting-rules-trusts-bare-trusts-faq.html#2.7">Question 2.7 &quot;What are some examples of trusts that need to file under the trust reporting rule?&quot;</a> on the &quot;Enhanced reporting rules for trusts and bare trusts: Frequently asked questions&quot; page.</p>
<h3 id="baretrusts">Bare trusts</h3>
<p>Effective for tax years ending on or after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023, bare trusts are subject to the trust reporting rules. However, the CRA will not require bare trusts to file a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 return</a>, including <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3sch15.html">Schedule 15</a>, for the 2023 and 2024 tax years, unless the CRA makes a direct request for these filings.</p>
<p>The term &quot;bare trust&quot; is not defined in the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. However, for income tax purposes, a bare trust is a trust arrangement under which the trustee can reasonably be considered to act as agent for all the beneficiaries under the trust regarding all dealings with all of the trust's property.</p>
<p>A trustee can reasonably be considered to act as agent for a beneficiary when the trustee:</p>
<div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-xs">
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>has no significant powers or responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>cannot take action without instructions from that beneficiary</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>the trustee’s only function is to hold legal title to the property</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the trustee to be considered as the agent for all the beneficiaries, it would generally be necessary for the trust to consult and take instructions from each and every beneficiary regarding all dealings with all of the trust property.</p>
<p>A typical scenario where a bare trust arrangement can occur is when a property developer establishes a bare trust arrangement to hold registered title to real property for privacy reasons while retaining beneficial ownership.</p>

        <h3>Internal trusts of registered charities</h3>
<p>The CRA will not require registered charities to file a T3 return for internal trusts.</p>
<p>Internal trusts are those created when a charity receives property as a gift that is subject to certain legally enforceable terms and conditions and holds that property as trustee of the trust. Refer to: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/filing-t3010-charity-return/before-file.html">Additional information on internal trusts of charities</a>.</p>
<h2>Rules for tax years ending before December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2023</h2>
<h3>Trusts that must file a T3 return for a tax year when certain situations apply</h3>
<p>All trusts (resident and non-resident) must file a T3 return for tax years in which the trust meets any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has tax payable</li>
<li>Is requested to file</li>
<li>Is a deemed resident trust</li>
<li>Is resident in Canada and has either disposed of, or is deemed to have disposed of, a capital property or has a taxable capital gain (for example, a principal residence, or shares in the capital stock of a corporation)</li>
<li>Is a non-resident throughout the year, and has a taxable capital gain (other than from an excluded disposition described in subsection 150(5)) or has disposed of taxable Canadian property (other than from an excluded disposition)</li>
<li>Holds property that is <a href="#subsection75-2" aria-controls="subsection75-2" class="wb-lbx" role="button">subject to&nbsp;subsection 75(2)&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a></li>
<li>Has provided a benefit of more than $100 to a beneficiary for upkeep, maintenance, or taxes for property maintained for the beneficiary’s use (for more information, see &quot;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4013/t3-trust-guide.html#P658_80781">Line 24&nbsp;– Upkeep, maintenance, and taxes of a property used or occupied by a beneficiary</a>&quot; in the T4013 T3 Trust Guide), or</li>
<li>Receives from the trust property any income, gain, or profit that is allocated to one or more beneficiaries, and the <a href="#trust-has-following" aria-controls="trust-has-following" class="wb-lbx" role="button">trust has <strong>any</strong> of the following&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a>:<ul>

<li>Made a distribution of capital to one or more beneficiaries</li>
<li>Allocated any portion of the income to a non-resident beneficiary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where the trust is an estate</h2>
<p>Generally, when someone has died, their belongings, property, assets and liabilities form their estate. An estate is considered to be a <a href="#testamentary-trust" aria-controls="testamentary-trust" class="wb-lbx" role="button">testamentary trust&nbsp;<span class="far fa-question-circle"></span></a> that arose on and as a consequence of an individual’s death. The legal representative of the deceased person is responsible for the administration of the estate. Find out more: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/life-events/doing-taxes-someone-died/represent-deceased.html">Represent someone who died</a>.</p>
<p>An estate may continue to earn income such as investment income or receive amounts such as a death benefit from an employer. Generally, a T3 return is required to be filed if there is any gain realized or payments received by the estate after the death.

<p>Where the trust is an estate, you may not need to file a T3 return if the estate is distributed immediately after the person dies, or if the estate did not earn income before the distribution. In these cases, you should give each beneficiary a statement showing their share of the estate.

<p>You might not need to file a T3 Return if the only income after death can be reported by a beneficiary. For example, the CPP/QPP death benefit can be reported on the beneficiary's return instead of on a T3 Return.

<p>Generally, this type of trust does not include a trust created by a person other than a deceased individual, or a trust created after November&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1981, if any property was contributed to it other than by a deceased individual as a consequence of the individual's death.

<li>owed to the beneficiary as a result of services provided by the beneficiary for the trust</li>
<li>owed to the beneficiary as a result of a payment on behalf of the trust for which property was transferred to the specified party within 12 months of the payment and the beneficiary would have made the payment had they been dealing with the trust at arm’s length</li>
